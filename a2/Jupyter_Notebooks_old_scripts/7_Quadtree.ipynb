    "# Building a Quadtree\n",
    "\n",
    "Download a file containing 1200 particle masses and positions: (see link). Considering only the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of these particles (between 0 and 150), construct a Barnes-Hut quadtree with at most 12 particles per leaf node. You can treat the masses and positions as dimensionless and use G=1. Plot the particles and indicate which particles are in which node (for example by drawing squares on the particle distribution like in the lecture). Calculate the n = 0 multipole moment of each leaf and then recursively for each node in the tree. Print the n = 0 multiple moment for the leaf node containing the particle with index i = 100 and that of all its parent nodes up to and including the root node. "
